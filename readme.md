During the entire month of October 2020, all you have to do is contribute to any open source projects and open at least 4 pull requests. Yes, any project and any kind of contributions. You don’t need to be an expert in programming or coding. It can be a be a bug fix, improvement, or even a documentation change! And win an awesome T-shirt and awesome stickers.

## 😕 Why Should I Contribute?
The Hacktoberfest’s simple plain objective is:

    Support open source and earn a limited edition T-shirt!

But, it’s not just about the t-shirts or stickers. Its about supporting open source. Its about celebrating open source, and giving it back. If you’ve never contributed to open source before, this is the perfect time to get started because Hacktoberfest provides a large list of available contribution opportunities (and yes, there are always plenty for beginners too).

## 👌 What Can I Contribute?

Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community.
